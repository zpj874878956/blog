### 配置文件如下

打开nginx.conf

```bash

user  nginx;
worker_processes  1;

error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;


events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}
stream {
  upstream ftp{
        #hash $remote_addr consistent;
        server ftp.cmegroup.com:21;
    }

server {
        listen 21;
        #listen 20;
        proxy_connect_timeout 300s;
        proxy_timeout 300s;
        proxy_pass ftp;
   }
}


http {
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
```

在需要访问代理的服务器上设置hosts

```bash
8.210.13.112 ftp.cmegroup.com
```

访问成功

```bash
